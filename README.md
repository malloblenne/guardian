# Guardian

During my childhood I was especially fond of a NES game named [The Guardian Legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian_Legend).
It came natural to me to start my adventure in the world of programming videogames by beginning with a tribute to this game.

## Purpose of the project

My idea is to keep the game logic as simple as possible and let it be my first little creature.
I don't want to make it too fancy, using design patterns like factory or adapters or others. I am also learning python in the middle, so the code is not super polished.
But I want to keep the game enjoyable and fun.
